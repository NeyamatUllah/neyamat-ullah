Hi, I'm Sheikh Md Neyamat Ullah 👋
Senior Software Engineer | DevOps | Cloud Infrastructure | Solution Architecture
I'm a software engineer with 15+ years of experience building and operating enterprise systems. Currently transitioning deeper into DevOps and Solution Architecture, combining my strong development background with cloud infrastructure, CI/CD automation, and Infrastructure as Code.
I've led cloud migrations from on-premise to AWS, built CI/CD pipelines with Azure DevOps, and architected full-stack enterprise solutions across automotive, aviation, and consulting industries — all in production, all at scale.
